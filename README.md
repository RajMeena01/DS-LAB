# DS-LAB
This repository contains a curated collection of Data Structure programs developed during my institute lab sessions. It features implementations of key data structures and algorithms using C++. The repository is designed to reinforce learning through practical coding exercises and examples.


- **Arrays:** Basic operations and manipulations.
- **Linked Lists:**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stacks & Queues:** LIFO and FIFO structures with applications.
- **Trees:**
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees
  - AVL Trees
- **Graphs:**
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Hashing:** Techniques for efficient data retrieval.
- **Heaps:**
  - Min-Heap
  - Max-Heap
- **Sorting & Searching:** Key algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.

Each program is accompanied by comments to explain the logic and approach, making it easier for others to understand and learn from the code. This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of data structures and algorithms.
